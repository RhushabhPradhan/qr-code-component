## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [CSS Reset](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-modern-css-reset/) - CSS Reset

### What I learned

1. This project was simple enough for a beginner to complete, and I enjoyed the creative process. 
2. I practised CSS flexbox and used unique CSS variables and properties.

Code snippets:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
    display: flex;
}
```

### Continued development

1. Using CSS Flexbox, this project was created. 
2. For clearer understanding, I also wanted to try developing this project using CSS grids.
3. In order to use CSS grids and variables more effectively in future projects, I would like to improve my understanding of them.
